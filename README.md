``./mvnw spring-boot:run``

You should now see in your browser the camunda login.

## Documentation

To set up the demo process engine. Create a list of environment variables and fill them with the necessary data.  
A list of them and with example data you can find here:
```
TASKANA_DB_HOST=localhost
TASKANA_DB_PORT=5432
TASKANA_DB_NAME=digiwf-process-engine
TASKANA_DB_USER=postgres
TASKANA_DB_PASSWORD=password
```

You can create this variables in a `.env` file. For *nix users add before every line `export` and add a space. For windows user add a `set ` for every line.  
*nix user can then do `source .env` to load the environment variables.
